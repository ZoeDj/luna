            <p>Tabby is any domestic cat (Felis catus) that has a coat featuring distinctive stripes, dots, lines or swirling patterns, <p>
                always together with a mark resembling an 'M' on its forehead. The tabby pattern is a naturally occurring feature <p>
                that may be related to the coloration of the domestic cat's direct ancestor, the African wildcat.
